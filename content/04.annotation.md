# TypemakeR

Given a Seurat object, a binarized dataframe and a maximum number of genes per type, 

find the best combination of markers (using AND, OR, NOR, XOR) that better captures the clusters


# TechnotypeR 

A simple annotation package for single-cell RNA-seq data based on the technotype framework.

Reference cell types based on markers.

_sensu stricto_ cell types

 - ID: QXXX

 - Markers:

    - Expresses X OR Y
        - A1
        - A2
    - Expresses X AND Y
        -B
        -C
    - NOT (Expresses X OR Y)
        -D1
        -D2

    - NOT (Expresses X AND Y)
        -F
        -G

Example

ID: Q001
label: "human B cell"

(at least 1)
    - Expresses X OR Y
        - MS4A1
        - CD79A
        - CD79B
(all)
    - Expresses X AND Y

(not express at least 1)
    - NOT (Expresses X OR Y)

(not express all)    
    - NOT (Expresses X AND Y)
        - CD3E
        - CD4
        - CD8A
        - NKG7


Steps:

    - User decides what counts as expressed --> binarization algorithm
    - Apply mask to dataset
    - Cells are labeled with multiple labels.
        - For each mask, test all cells. 
            - If a mask fits, label as technotype (e.g, using dataset_ID_Q001)
            - Relate technotype as a subclass of the uper class (e.g Q001)
